# Getting the source

Checkout the project from github with:

    git clone https://github.com/crosswalk-project/grunt-crosswalk.git

The instructions below assume you are working from inside the grunt-crosswalk project root (i.e. the directory you cloned the repo to).

You will need to install node and npm (the latter is included in recent versions of node).

Once you have these, install the dependencies for the project with:

    npm install .

# Build tasks

grunt-crosswalk doesn't require any compilation - there is a grunt task to facilitate releasing and publishing.
